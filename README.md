# Random Password Generator
Random Password Generator is a simple, easy-to-use program that generates strong, secure passwords. You can customize the length and the characters of the password, and copy it to the clipboard with one click.

# Benefits of Generating Random Passwords
Random passwords are passwords that are generated by a program or an algorithm, rather than by a human. 
They are usually composed of a combination of characters, such as lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and symbols. 
Random passwords have many benefits over human-generated passwords, such as:

1. **Security**: They are more secure and harder to guess or crack by hackers or malicious software.
Human-generated passwords often follow predictable patterns, such as using personal information, common words, or simple substitutions.
Random passwords are more complex and random, which makes them more resistant to brute-force attacks or dictionary attacks.
2. **Uniqueness**: They are more unique and less likely to be reused across different accounts or services. 
Human-generated passwords tend to be reused or slightly modified for convenience or memorability, which increases the risk of compromising multiple accounts if one of them is breached. 
Random passwords are more diverse and unlikely to be repeated, which reduces the exposure and impact of a potential breach.
3. **Convenience**: They are easier to manage and store with a password manager or a clipboard. 
Human-generated passwords can be hard to remember or type, especially if they are long or complex. 
Random passwords can be easily generated, copied, and pasted with a program or a tool, such as Random Password Generator which saves time and effort for the user.
